//! Enumeration of the possible shapes of the children of a [`Node`](super::Node).
//!
//! Each complete node must have at least one child, but some other children may be missing because
//! they have been pruned from the sparse tree.
//!
//! The reason for this enumeration is to save heap space in the case of many nodes: because
//! different nodes can have different sizes, we save on average a few words of memory by placing
//! the box inside each enum variant rather than outside the whole enum (which would end up
//! occupying the space of its largest variant).
